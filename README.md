# Probabilistic Machine Learning Thesis  
**Neural Networks, Gaussian Processes and Bayesian Inference applied to real-world data**

This repository contains my Bachelor's thesis in Physics, where I developed a complete **probabilistic machine learning pipeline** using **Neural Networks, Gaussian Processes and Bayesian Inference** to model, reconstruct and analyze **real observational data**.

Although the thesis document is written in Portuguese, all methods, results and figures follow international standards in **Machine Learning, Data Science and Statistical Modeling**.

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project was to extract reliable information from **noisy, real-world data** using **modern machine learning and statistical inference techniques**.

The project combines:

- **Neural Networks** for nonlinear regression and data reconstruction  
- **Gaussian Process Regression** for probabilistic modeling and uncertainty estimation  
- **Bayesian Inference** to infer physical and statistical parameters  
- **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)** for posterior sampling  
- **Uncertainty Quantification and Model Comparison**

The methods were applied to real observational datasets (supernovae, quasars, galaxies and time-series measurements), but the core of the project is the **machine learning and inference pipeline**, which is directly applicable to any data-driven domain.
