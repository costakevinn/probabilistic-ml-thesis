# Probabilistic Machine Learning Thesis  
**Neural Networks, Gaussian Processes and Bayesian Inference for real-world data modeling**

This repository presents my Bachelor's thesis, focused on building a **probabilistic machine learning pipeline** to model, reconstruct and analyze **real, noisy datasets** using **Neural Networks, Gaussian Processes and Bayesian inference**.

The project was fully implemented in **Python** and follows the same modeling, validation and uncertainty estimation workflows used in **machine learning engineering, data science and AI research**.

## 🚀 Project Summary

The objective of this project was to extract reliable patterns and parameters from **complex observational data** using **probabilistic machine learning models**.

The pipeline includes:

- **Neural Networks** for nonlinear regression  
- **Gaussian Process Regression** for probabilistic predictions  
- **Bayesian Inference** for parameter estimation  
- **Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)** for posterior sampling  
- **Uncertainty Quantification and Model Comparison**

Although the datasets come from astrophysical observations, the methodology is fully **domain-agnostic** and directly applicable to **finance, healthcare, industrial analytics, and any real-world data problem**.
